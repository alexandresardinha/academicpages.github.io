excerpt: 'This paper is about my master thesis. We proposed _SCC-map_, an instruction/task [scheduling algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheduling_(computing)) based on [Strongly Connected Components (SCC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strongly_connected_component) for [Dataflow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dataflow) architectures.'
