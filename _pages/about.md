Hi! I'm Alexandre Sardinha, a software engineer at [Petrobras](http://www.petrobras.com.br), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
I work with geophysics applications and seismic imaging (e.g. RTM) on HPC clusters.
My areas of interest are computer architecture, parallel programming, GPGPU, optimization and performance tuning tools.

I've received my M.Sc. from [Systems Engineering and Computer Science Program](http://www.cos.ufrj.br) at Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ) and my B.Sc. from [Computer Science Department](http://www.dcc.ufrj.br) at UFRJ.

In my personal life, I like to play futsal, watch alternative movies, listen to music and travel.
